# microarch-benchmarks

This repo contains a set of benchmarks based on the Phoronix Test Suite, that test against various different x86 microarchitectures (x86-64-v{1..4}, znver4, native, etc...)

Run `./run_all.sh` to get started, then `./merge.sh` and look at the results in `test-results/merged.html`.
